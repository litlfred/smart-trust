/**
 * Render smart-trust's reader-facing pages from the artefact index.
 *
 * @module smart-trust/scripts/gen-smart-trust-pages
 * @covers fhir-artifact-index
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `fhir-artifact-index` is registered `renderable: false`, and `smart-trust/`
 * declared exactly one directory of exactly that kind — so 674 ingested
 * artefacts were reachable at no URL. The owner found it by asking where
 * `/smart-trust` was. Only two of this repository's graph kinds are renderable
 * (`docs` and `folio`), and `who-iris/` publishes because it declares a
 * `docs/` directory alongside its `catalogue/`. This generator writes the
 * equivalent for smart-trust.
 *
 * **The URL the owner expected is the right one.** `withRoutes` in
 * `cat-harness/scripts/mount-instance-docs.ts` publishes an instance at
 * `/<kind>/<instance>/` for every renderable kind AND once at `/<instance>/`,
 * its themed root. A `docs` graph here therefore serves both
 * `/docs/smart-trust/` and `/smart-trust/`.
 *
 * ## Generated from the index, never transcribed
 *
 * Every artefact, count, canonical URL and link on these pages is read out of
 * `smart-trust/fhir-artifact-index/index.json`. Hand-writing them would
 * produce pages that agree with the index exactly once — on the day they were
 * written. `--check` is what keeps that from happening quietly, and it is
 * wired into the gate set.
 *
 * That is the same discipline the index itself carries: `smart-trust/AGENTS.md`
 * says nothing under the graph is authored, and this directory is no different.
 *
 * ## What the pages say, and what they refuse to imply
 *
 * **A referenced artefact is not a broken one.** 655 of the 674 are
 * `referenced` — the index knows where they live and holds none of their
 * bytes. Following `gen-iris-pages.ts`, no row is greyed out: a disabled-looking
 * row reads as "broken", while a row stating **referenced** reads as "upstream,
 * not here", which is the actual state and the whole point of cataloguing by
 * reference.
 *
 * **Two link targets, never conflated.** An artefact's canonical URL
 * (`http://smart.who.int/trust/...`) is its IDENTITY; its published URL
 * (`https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/smart-trust/...`) is where bytes
 * are served. smart-trust is canonical at one host and published at another,
 * so composing either from the other would write a link that resolves for
 * nobody. Both come from the index.
 *
 * **No WHO logo.** Same instruction the who-iris pages follow: until published
 * under WHO, colour carries the identity and the wordmark is set in type. A
 * replica carrying the real mark is indistinguishable from the real thing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run smart-trust/scripts/gen-smart-trust-pages.ts
 *   bun run smart-trust/scripts/gen-smart-trust-pages.ts --check

 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21: *"i want the input/page(s)/ content to be rendered
 * viajustthedocs pipeline. use metadataetc fro IG publisher to populate the
 * variables jekyl processes."*
 *
 * These pages were `<!doctype html>` documents with their own `<head>`,
 * copied into `_site` AFTER Jekyll by `mount-instance-docs.ts` — so they
 * inherited **nothing**: no sidebar, no language bar, no QA badges, no search.
 * `hw9g` had to inject a navigation rail into them precisely because the
 * pipeline never saw them. Composed instead, they are ordinary folio pages and
 * the rail is unnecessary here (it stays necessary for `who-iris`, which is a
 * deliberate replica of somebody else's site).
 *
 * ## The body is still HTML, and that is the MVP line
 *
 * kramdown passes raw HTML through, so front matter alone converts these into
 * real pages without rewriting every emitter in one go. What that buys is the
 * chrome; what it does not buy is markdown semantics — no automatic heading
 * anchors, no table-of-contents, and `{{ }}` in a body would be read as Liquid.
 * Converting each body to markdown is the parity work the owner asked to be
 * taken "until rendering parity-ish", and it can now happen page by page
 * against a site that already renders.
 *
 * ## Titles and description come from the INDEX
 *
 * "use metadata … to populate the variables jekyl processes" — `title` and
 * `description` are the index's own, never typed here, which is the same rule
 * the rest of this generator follows.
