/**
 * The smart-trust pages are MARKDOWN, and their links resolve to files.
 *
 * These pages used to be HTML wearing front matter: a full `<style>` sheet
 * that re-declared `body`, its own colour scheme and its own
 * `prefers-color-scheme` block, then `<table>`/`<tr>`/`<h2>` for every row and
 * heading. `index.md` was **631 lines, 186 of them HTML**. Everything in that
 * list is something just-the-docs already does, and a page that redeclares it
 * is a page that stops matching the theme the first time the theme changes —
 * which is exactly what the dark-mode figure defect was.
 *
 * Two defects were found by READING the regenerated output, and both are
 * pinned here because neither is visible in the generator:
 *
 * 1. `repLinks` joined its four representation links with `""`, rendering
 *    `jsonxmlttlhtml` as one run-on word. A separator is a rendering fact, so
 *    the assertion is on the RENDERED page rather than on the join call.
 * 2. The index linked each artefact as `./artifact/Name/`. This site's
 *    `cat-harness/docs/_config.yml` sets **no `permalink`**, so Jekyll's
 *    default emits `artifact/Name.html` and every one of the 19 links would
 *    have 404'd once built. Locally both spellings look identical — the file
 *    is `.md` either way — so the only test that could catch it is one that
 *    reads the href and resolves it back to a file.
 *
 * SINCE 2026-10-05 (bean `mftp`) these are the artefact pages of ONE site:
 * `docs/` declares `igSite`, so they build into smart-trust's own IG site at
 * `/smart-trust/`, whose index, toc and artifacts pages `build-ig-site`
 * writes. The generator no longer writes an index, menu sections or category
 * pages here, and the assertions about them were retargeted at what replaced
 * them — the IG site's `artifacts` page links — rather than deleted silently.
 *
